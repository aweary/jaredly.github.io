# I want to change the world.
I'm an unashamed idealist, prepared to defend my opinions, but not afraid to change my position when presented with a better one. The most important aspect of my life is my connection to God.

I'm currently a mobile & web developer for Khan Academy, where we're working to bring a free, world-class education to anyone anywhere. If you want to help, send me an email!

# Religion
Through prayer, study, discussion and application, I have come to know God.  This has brought me indescribable happiness and incredible peace.

From August 2010 to July 2012 I served as a mormon missionary in Frankfurt, Germany, and the surrounding cities. My wife served a mission in Peru from 2013-2014.

# Politics
I consider myself to be socially conservative and fiscally liberal, but above all I believe that we are more alike than we are different, and that humility and empathy should guide our discussion.

I tend to have strong opinions which are sometimes well-grounded, but I try to own it when I don't have much to back up my initial impression.

# Economics
A professor of mine once said "money's a pain; once you have enough, anything more is just increased stewardship". I believe in being fiscally responsible regardless of how much money I have. I don't want the deciding question to be "can I afford this", but rather "is this a responsible use of this money?" I don't want to justify spending by excess on unnecessary things while people around me struggle to make ends meet.
